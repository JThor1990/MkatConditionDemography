# Linking climate variability to demography in arid environments: a mechanistic study in Kalahari meerkats

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing the relationship between climate variability and meerkat demography. 

The aim of our study was to develop a mechanistic understanding of how rainfall and temperature variation affects meerkat demography. Specifically, we:
- Identified the critical period during which rainfall influences vegetation productivity at the field site.
- Investigated how vegetation productivity and temperature influence meerkat foraging performance.
- Examined how these climatic variables impact daily weight fluctuations and overall body condition.
- Analyzed conditions under which meerkats fail to accumulate enough mass during foraging to offset overnight losses.
- Explored the influence of body condition on reproduction and survival.
- Projected future temperature trends and their implications for meerkat populations up to the mid and end of the century.

The R code is placed within 6 scripts, each of which carries out a specific analysis or model contained within the paper:  
(1) Part1_RainfallNDVI_Climwin.R  
(2) Part2_ForagingPerformance.R  
(3) Part3_DWGandOML.R  
(4) Part4_DistributedLagModels.R  
(5) Part5_VitalRates.R  
(6) Part6_FutureWarmingKalahari.R  

The scripts were produced by Dr Jack Thorley and Dr Christopher Duncan). All data sets are provided in the repository.
